# SPARK-Addtion
SPARK-Addition is a program designed to search for spatial variable genes, which is a hot topic in bioinformatics. Based on SPARK, the program improved the kernel function presenting the spatial expression patterns and modified the calculation rules of P-value. This makes SPARK-Addition perform better than the original SPARK.
